This repository includes concise implementations of fundamental sorting algorithms in various programming languages.

    Bubble Sort:
        bubble_sort.py: Simple comparison-based algorithm iterating through the list, swapping adjacent elements if in the wrong order.

    Selection Sort:
        selection_sort.py: In-place algorithm dividing input into sorted and unsorted regions, selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region, and swapping with the first element of the unsorted region.

    Insertion Sort:
        insertion_sort.py: Builds the final sorted array one element at a time, less efficient on large lists.

    Merge Sort:
        merge_sort.py: Efficient, stable, and comparison-based algorithm dividing input into smaller sections, sorting them, and merging them back together.

    Quick Sort:
        quick_sort.py: Divide-and-conquer algorithm selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the other elements based on their relation to the pivot.

Usage

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-algorithms.git

    Choose a sorting algorithm implementation and language.

    Execute the code to observe the sorting behavior on an array.
